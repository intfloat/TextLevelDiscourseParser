45 53 44 background elaboration-additional    Investors with a heavy tax load should take out their calculators. 
46 45 45 elaboration-additional example    Yields on municipal bonds can be higher than after-tax yields on CDs for maturities of perhaps one to five years. 
47 46 45 explanation-argumentative example    That's because municipal-bond interest is exempt from federal income tax 
48 47 47 elaboration-additional List    -- and from state and local taxes too, for in-state investors.
